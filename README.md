Personal JavaScript solutions to the Project Euler Problems

## Why?

After solving some challenges in [leetcodeJS](https://github.com/anubhavsrivastava/leetcodeJS), I came to know about Project Euler (had heard of it earlier but didn't payed heed to it), that it bring more of mathematics to CS. This is yet another personal attempt for solving standard problems.
Project Euler problems are available at [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/).

## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## Who are the problems aimed at?

The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.

## Environment

Chrome/Nodejs (depending on time taken, easy-small problems on browser)

## Problem Organisation

Project Euler problem are standard set of problem in organised sense. Will solve them in order since they themselves are ordered by level of difficulty.
